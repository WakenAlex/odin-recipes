        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarma_(food)#:~:text=Sarmale%20in%20Romania%20are%20also,leaf%2C%20usually%20a%20cabbage%20leaf." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Sarmale</strong></em></a> is a Romanian dish featuring cabbage leaves stuffed with a mixture of minced meat (typically pork or a combination of pork and beef), rice, finely chopped onions, salt, pepper, and herbs. The cabbage leaves are blanched to soften them, then filled with the meat and rice mixture and rolled into neat parcels. These parcels are arranged snugly in a pot, layered with additional cabbage leaves, and cooked slowly in a seasoned broth until tender and flavorful. Served hot, accompanied by sour cream and a side of polenta or crusty bread, sarmale is a hearty and comforting dish perfect for any occasion.</p>
